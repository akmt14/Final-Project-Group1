# Deep Learning Project on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset 

For the final project for DATS 6203 (Machine Learning II - Deep Learning), we decided to work on The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset. This is a real-world image dataset for developing object detection algorithms. We built models on 4 frameworks - PyTorch, Caffe, TensorFlow & Keras to try and classify the images to their targets.
